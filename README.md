## About framework stability and uniqueness 

‚ñ† Does it remain the same after application reinstalling? If it‚Äôs possible, implement it, if not ‚Äì describe why.
‚ñ† If your library is used in two different applications, will the ID that your library provides be the same inside of these two apps?

Answer is below for above questions

Early iOS releases gave every device a unique identifier, but this was soon abused by developers to identify individual users uniquely ‚Äì something that Apple really dislikes. So, Apple removed the truly unique identifier and instead introduced an identifier for each vendor: a UUID that's the same for all apps for a given developer for each user, but varies between developers and between devices. That is, if a user has five of your apps installed and five of mine, your five will all share the same vendor identifier.
